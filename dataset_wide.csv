The action, which takes place in a single day, concerns an American businessman, Grover Bemis, who following a breakdown retires to rural southern Mexico to recuperate. But a corrupt fascist Mexican general, Orijas, gets out of jail and – backed by Nazi money – aims to set up a Hitler-like dictatorship in Mexico. His first target happens to be the village Bemis has retired to. The general and his men cripple the power plant to put the villagers at their mercy, and capture the idealistic village leader Trinidad, bringing him to a drumhead trial as a communist. Bemis slips away, impersonates the village's patron saint, manages to restore power (by what the villagers consider a miracle), and gets a message through to the local government; Trinidad is saved and the villagers turn out Orijas. Bemis gives a speech at the curtain, avowing as to how it all really was a miracle, as the good in man always fights against evil, and this is the greatest miracle of all.

I have just heard a sound that probably corresponds to the following text description: Animal. For example, a Dog is a Mammal because dogs inherit certain characteristics from Mammals, such as mammary glands and (through Mammal's parent, Vertebrate) a backbone. On the other hand, dogs also may have one of several distinct types of behavior, and these behaviours may change over time. For example, a Dog may be a Pet, a Stray (an abandoned pet will acquire behaviours to survive not associated with a pet), or a Guide for the blind (guide dogs are trained, so they do not start life as guide dogs). However, these are sets of additional behaviors that can be added to a Dog. It is also possible to describe these behaviors in such a way that they can be usefully applied to other animals, for example, a Cat can equally be a Pet or Stray. Hence, Dog and Cat are distinct from each other, while both remain within the more general category Mammal. So Mammal is a Class and Dog and Cat are classes that inherit from Mammal. But the behaviours associated with Pet, Stray, and Guide are Roles that can be added to Classes, or objects instantiated from Classes. Please imagine that you have just heard the same thing. What is happening here? ", Dog is barking.

This provision is a ""subjective immission"" control with a curfew. It has been used to regulate the sound of model aircraft on both private and public property.

It translates as follows: ""As in life there can be nothing happier than a marriage in unison and a bed without discord, there is nothing more pleasant than to see one's offspring in unison enjoy peace with an immaculate mind, 1561"".
